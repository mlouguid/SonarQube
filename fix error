The error message indicates that Elasticsearch failed to start because the vm.max_map_count setting is too low. This is a common issue when running Elasticsearch, as it requires a higher setting for virtual memory.

Here's how you can resolve this:

Increase vm.max_map_count:
You need to increase the vm.max_map_count setting on your host machine. You can do this by running the following command:

$ sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
Make the change persistent:
To ensure that this change persists across reboots, add the following line to your /etc/sysctl.conf file:

$ echo "vm.max_map_count=262144" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
After making these changes, restart your system or reload the sysctl settings:

$ sudo sysctl -p
Once you've done this, try starting your Docker containers again:

$ docker-compose up -d
This should resolve the issue, and Elasticsearch should start without the bootstrap check failure.
